‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (LTS version recommended) & npm (comes with Node.js)

Download from: https://nodejs.org/

MongoDB Community Server

Download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

Ensure you start the MongoDB server (mongod) before running the backend.

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Aura_chat_app.git
cd Aura_chat_app

(Replace YourUsername with your actual GitHub username once uploaded)

2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the server directory, install dependencies, and start the server.

cd server
npm install
npm run start:dev # Or `npm start` for production

Note: Ensure your server/package.json has a script like "start:dev": "nodemon index.js" or similar for development.

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window, navigate to the client directory, install dependencies, and start the development server.

cd client
npm install
npm run dev

This will typically open your application in your browser at http://localhost:5173 (or a similar port).

üì¶ Deployment
The original tutorial demonstrated deployment on Hostinger VPS. For production, you would typically build the client assets and then serve them from your Node.js server or a separate static hosting service.

Building Client for Production
cd client
npm run build

This command creates a dist folder in your client directory, containing the optimized static assets. You can then configure your Node.js server to serve these files.
